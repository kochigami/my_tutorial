A McNemar Test was performed to examine the relation between the approval of construction of nuclear power plant and a lecture which tells the risk of nuclear power. The relation between these variables was significant, X^2(1)=18.23, p<.01. People after taking a lecture were less likely to agree the construction of a nuclear plant than were people before taking a lecture.
