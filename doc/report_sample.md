## Two sample Test (nominal scale)
```
A McNemar Test was performed to examine the relation between the approval of construction of nuclear power plant and a lecture which tells the risk of nuclear power. The relation between these variables was significant, X^2(1)=18.23, p<.01. People after taking a lecture were less likely to agree the construction of a nuclear plant than were people before taking a lecture.

A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relation between  whether a person is healthy or not healthy and whether a person has a habit of smoking or not. The relation between these variables was significant, X^2(1)=16.53, p<.01. People who are not healthy were more likely to have a habit of smoking than were people who are healthy.

```
Fisher's Exact Test indicated that teachers considered less seriously non-social children's behaviors 7.7% (1/13), compared to counselors 40% (4/10) (p=0.089).
```

## Two sample Test (ordinal scale)

```
A Mann-Whitney test indicated that the number of trials which satisfied the learning criteria was greater for mice which did not eat anything for 48 hours (Mdn=47.0) than for mice which did not eat anything for 24 hours (Mdn=91.5), U=117.5, p=0.008.
```

```
A sign test indicated that there is not significant difference between the score of cusine A (Mdn=3.5) and that of cusine B (Mdn=3.0); p=0.34.
```

```
A sign test indicated that there is not significant difference between the score of cusine A (Mdn=3.0) and that of cusine B (Mdn=3.0); Z=-0.98, p=0.34.
```

```
A Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks Test indicated that the number of times people used product A in three months (Mdn=33.5) was statistically significantly higher than the number of times people used product B in three months (Mdn=22.5); T=4.5, n=9, p<.005. 
```

## Two sample Test (interval and ratio scale)

```
Welch test was conducted to compare scores of mathematics mini test in class A and class B conditions. There was a significant difference in the scores for class A (M=14.57, SD=0.47) and class B (M=14.10, SD=0.27) conditions; t(14)=2.64, p=0.0098.
```

```
An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare scores of taste in WakuWaku Burger and MoguMogu Burger conditions. There was not a significant difference in the scores for WakuWaku Burger (M=76.88, SD=7.043) and MoguMogu Burger (M=81.88, SD=7.474) conditions; t(14)=12.9, p=0.11.
```

```
A paired-samples t-test was conducted to compare scores of taste in WakuWaku Burger and MoguMogu Burger conditions. There was a significant difference in the scores for WakuWaku Burger (M=76.88, SD=6.585) and MoguMogu Burger (M=81.25, SD=5.995) conditions; t(7)=-2.97, p=0.021. 
```

## Multiple sample Test (nominal)

```
A chi-square test of independence was performed to examine the relation between learning method (vision, audition, vision + audition) and the place of the learning word people remembered. 
The relation between these variables was significant, X^2(2) = 9.69, p<.01. <ex. Catholic teens> were less likely to <ex. show an interest in attending college> than were <ex. Protestant teens>.
```

```
A Cochran's Q Test was performed to compare an approval rating between Candidate A, Candidate B and Candidate C.
It rendered a X^2(<fill dof, ex. 2>) = 8.0 which was significant (p = 0.018).
Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that the mean score for the Candidate C (Total=14) was significantly different than the Candidate A (Total=6). 
```

## Multiple sample Test (ordinal)

```
A Kruskal Wallis Test indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the time which infants reacted to a specific stimulus (H(2) =7.06, p=0.017), with a mean rank of 11.2 for condition1, 12.5 for condition2, 4.83 for condition3. 

Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated that the mean score for the condition2 (M=12.5, SD=4.5) was significantly different than the condition3 (M=4.83, SD=3.02). 
The mean score for the condition1 (M=11.2, SD=4.22) was significantly different than the condition3 (M=4.83, SD=3.02). 
However, the condition1 (M=11.2, SD=4.22) did not significantly differ from codition2.
```

```
A non-parametric Friedman test of differences among repeated measures was conducted and rendered a Chi-square value of 3.66, which was not significant (p =  0.55).
