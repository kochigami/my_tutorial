## Two sample Test (nominal scale)

A McNemar Test was performed to examine the relation between the approval of construction of nuclear power plant and a lecture which tells the risk of nuclear power. The relation between these variables was significant, X^2(1)=18.23, p<.01. People after taking a lecture were less likely to agree the construction of a nuclear plant than were people before taking a lecture.

```
A Kruskal Wallis Test indicated that there was a statistically significant difference between the time which infants reacted to a specific stimulus (H(2) =7.06, p=0.017), with a mean rank of 11.2 for condition1, 12.5 for condition2, 4.83 for condition3. 

Post hoc comparisons using Ryan's method indicated that the mean score for the condition2 (M=12.5, SD=2.66) was significantly different than the condition3 (M=4.83, SD=0.81). 
The mean score for the condition1 (M=11.2, SD=1.27) was significantly different than the condition3 (M=4.83, SD=0.82). 
However, the condition1 did not significantly differ from codition2.

## Multiple sample Test (interval and ratio)

```
A one-way between subjects ANOVA was conducted to compare the effect of a type of hamburger on the score of taste.

An analysis of variance showed that the effect of a type of hamburger on the score was significant at the p<.05 level, F(2, 55)=12.26, p=0.001. 

Post hoc comparisons using the holm test indicated that the mean score for the HamburgerA (M=84.0, SD=5.39) was significantly different than the HamburgerB (M=79.5, SD=5.45) (p<.001). 
The HamburgerA (M=84.0, SD=5.39) was significantly different than the HamburgerC (M=88.5, SD=5.52) (p=0.0076). 
The HamburgerB (M=79.5, SD=5.45) was significantly different than the HamburgerC (M=88.5, SD=5.52) (p=0.0091).

A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was conducted to compare the effect of a type of hamburger on the score of taste.

These data consist of the scores of 20 people. Each person was evaluated under three conditions. 

The results of a one-way repeated measures ANOVA show that the score of taste was significantly affected by a type of hamburger, F(2, 38)=23.17, p=0.001.
The score of taste was significantly affected by a type of subject, F(19, 38)=3.69, p=0.001.

Post hoc comparisons using the Holm test indicated that there was no significant difference between HamburgerA (M=84.0, SD=5.39), HamburgerB (M=79.5, SD=5.45) and HamburgerC (M=88.2, SD=5.34).

A two-way between subjects ANOVA was conducted on the influence of two independent variables (robot type and people age) on the number of a score of people's satisfactiory of interaction with a robot. 

Robot type included two levels (NAO and Pepper) and people age consisted of two levels (Adult and Children). 

All effects were statistically significant at the .05 significance level except for robot type.

The main effect for robot type type yielded an F ratio of F(1, 54)=1.48, p=0.23, indicating a significant difference between NAO (M=75.3, SD=8.56), Pepper (M=72.9, SD=7.49).

The main effect for people age yielded an F ratio of F(1, 54)=4.15, p=0.047, indicating a significant difference between Children (M=72.0, SD=7.36) and Adults (M=76.2, SD=8.33).

The interaction effect was significant, F(1, 54)=5.02, p=0.03.

Post hoc comparisons using the Hlm test indicated a significant difference between NAO & Adults (M=79.67, SD=7.63) and Pepper & Adults (M=72.67, SD=7.50), and NAO & Children (M=71.0, SD=7.12) and NAO & Adults (M=79.67, SD=7.63).
No other comparisons were statically significant.

The sleep quality (percentage of time spent in delta sleep) of people with a1 and a2 (N=2x5) was measured when sleeping with b1, b2, b3 and b4. 

(If a harmonious relationship has a stress reducing effect, we expect sleep quality to improve in the presence of their partner especially for securely attached women.)

A 2 x 4 ANOVA with category of a1 & a2 as an independent factor and category of b1, b2, b3 and b4 as a within-subjects factor was run. 

The analysis revealed a main effect of a category of a1 & a2 (F(1, 8)=2.91, p=0.102) in the predicted direction, a main effect of a category of b1, b2, b3 and b4 (F(3, 24)=5.21, p=0.007) and an interaction between a category of a1 & a2 and a category of b1, b2, b3 and b4 (F(3, 24)=8.06, p=0.001). 

(As predicted, women with a1 slept better than either of the other two groups (p = .001) and they experienced the greatest improvement in sleep quality by the presence of their partners.)

We can report that there was a significant main effect of Factor1, F(1, 4)=8.1, p=0.047.
We can report that there was a significant main effect of Factor2, F(3, 12) =6.04, p=0.01.
We can report that there was a significant interaction between Factor1 and Factor2, F(3, 12)=7.08, p=0.006.
